\chapter{Euclidean algorithm}
\label{ch:euclid}

The goal of this chapter is to study the \term{Euclidean algorithm},
which is an algorithm for quickly finding the greatest common divisor
of two numbers.

First, we're going to go over some basics, starting with some
inductive proofs about properties of the natural numbers.
